# Python

Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language created by Guido van Rossum in 1991. 

Python is dynamically typed, garbage-collected and supports multiple programming paradigms such as procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming. 

This repository uses Python 3.0, released in 2008 and is not completely backward-compatible.


## The Zen of Python

The Zen of Python is a set of 19 "guiding principles" for writing computer programs and influences the design of the Python programming language.


          1. Beautiful is better than ugly.
          2. Explicit is better than implicit.
          3. Simple is better than complex.
          4. Complex is better than complicated.
          5. Flat is better than nested.
          6. Sparse is better than dense.
          7. Readability counts.
          8. Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
          9. Although practicality beats purity.
          10. Errors should never pass silently.
          11. Unless explicitly silenced.
          12. In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
          13. There should be one—and preferably only one—obvious way to do it.
          14. Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
          15. Now is better than never.
          16. Although never is often better than right now.[n 1]
          17. If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
          18. If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
          19. Namespaces are one honking great idea—let's do more of those!


## The Repository
The repository for Python is like a folder or storage space that contains all the files such as code, documentation, images, and more related to my experiments with Python programming language. It also tracks every change that I or my team makes to each file.
